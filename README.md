# React Router v6 Unexpected Route Matching
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router v6: unexpected route matching and navigation problems.

The bug involves incorrect route matching, leading to unintended page displays or navigation failures. The solution provides a corrected implementation to address these issues.

## Bug
The initial `App.js` demonstrates incorrect route configuration.  Routes may not match as expected, causing the wrong components to render or navigation to fail silently.

## Solution
The `AppSolution.js` shows the corrected code with proper route definitions and handling to fix the unexpected route matching behavior.  Key improvements include careful consideration of path specificity and potential wildcard route conflicts.
